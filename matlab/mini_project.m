% Simulation parameters
%	These are values particular to the simulation 
%	that do not change later in the script

% Computed parameters (from simulation parameters)
%	These are values that do not change later in the script
%	and are calculated from formulas using the simulation parameters

% Function calls and simple calculations for:
%	data read-in
%	simulation solution 
%	visualization
% 

% Function definitions for simulation solution & visualization
%	Each function contains help text: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html
% (see documentation on local script functions: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/local-functions-in-scripts.html)
